Project Title: Loan Default Prediction Using Machine Learning

Description:
Developed a predictive model to assess the likelihood of loan default, enhancing risk management for financial institutions. The project involved comprehensive data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of various machine learning algorithms to accurately predict loan defaults.

Key Responsibilities:
- Conducted data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis on a dataset of over 10,000 loan records, identifying key trends and outliers.
- Applied statistical techniques and visualizations using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to understand the relationships between features like applicant income, credit history, and loan status.
- Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to determine the most effective predictive approach.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize model performance, achieving an accuracy improvement of 15% over the baseline.
- Implemented the final model using Scikit-learn and deployed it using a Flask API for real-time predictions.

Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook, Flask, Git

Outcome:
The project resulted in a robust model that helped reduce the default rate by accurately identifying high-risk applicants. This allowed the financial institution to improve its decision-making process, reduce financial losses, and better allocate resources to lower-risk borrowers.
